Django-based-database
---
This project is a direct tutorial for building a web application database using django rest framework and AWS from scratch and a simple handbook of how to maintain the usability. 

Duration: 1-2 weeks to build and setup

Motivation: Many companies stay with the tradtional data storage methods, such as manually saving as a single excel in HDD, or storing thousands of files in Cloud Drive like OneDrive. However, they are not safe and efficient for frequent use in a daily manner. Constantly opening and closing Excel that contains thousands of sheets will cause the program randering slow and easy to crash; and OneDrive has the consistent issue of losing T-1 backup files. Therefore, I wanted to find a way to store and protect data in a more organizable and easier way, while being less costly. This is why I found Django, which helps me build a SQL database in a considerably short time in Python. 

Reason: Reduce the risk of losing data, improve the efficiency to query and store data, shorten the latency of loading data, and use database wherever I go. 

Applications and services: AWS EC2, AWS RDs, AWS S3, Django, Django Restframe work, VSC.

Learn: How to build Django web application for database usage, how to build and test the pipeline for database, how to connect local Django to AWS and test the compatability. 

Current difficulty: Extra cost from AWS RDs, Insufficienty protection for database, Limited front-end related knowledge.
